## Overview
In this project, I will classify the Fashion-MNIST dataset using convolutional neural networks (with Batch Normalization).

## Aim of the Project
The aim of this project is to develop a convolutional neural network with batch normalization layers that can accurately classify images from the Fashion-MNIST dataset. The project involves creating a dataset class, building and training the model, and evaluating its performance.

## Technologies Used
- **Programming Language:** Python
- **Libraries:** PyTorch, torchvision, numpy
- **Tools:** Jupyter Notebook, Git, VS Code

## Prerequisites
- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook
- Git

## Installation & How to Run
To set up and run the project locally:

1. **Clone the Repository**:
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/ImaadhRenosh/Fashion-MNIST-clothe-image-classifier.git
    cd Fashion-MNIST-clothe-image-classifier
    ```

2. **Install Dependencies**: Install the required libraries using:
    ```sh
    pip install torch torchvision numpy jupyter
    ```

3. **Run the Jupyter Notebook**: Launch Jupyter Notebook and open `Fashion_MNIST_Classifier.ipynb`.

## Demo
(TODO: Add images or screenshots of the model training and evaluation process)

## Usage
After launching the Jupyter Notebook, you can:
- Load and preprocess the Fashion-MNIST dataset.
- Define the convolutional neural network with batch normalization.
- Train the model on the dataset.
- Evaluate the model's performance.
